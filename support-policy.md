## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I create my first meal plan?**  
A: Open the app and navigate to the Meal Calendar. Tap on a date and select the meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack). Choose a recipe from your library or create a new one. Your meal will be added to the calendar automatically.

**Q: How does the automatic grocery list work?**  
A: When you plan meals in your calendar, the app automatically extracts all ingredients and adds them to your grocery list. Items are intelligently categorized by type (produce, dairy, meat, etc.) for efficient shopping.

**Q: How do I set up family sharing?**  
A: Family sharing uses Apple's CloudKit technology. In the app settings, enable Family Sharing and invite family members via their Apple ID email. Once they accept, all meal plans, recipes, grocery lists, and inventory will sync automatically across all family members' devices.

### Recipe Management

**Q: Can I import recipes from websites?**  
A: Currently, recipes need to be manually entered. You can copy and paste ingredient lists and instructions to speed up the process. We're exploring recipe import features for future updates.

**Q: How do I mark a recipe as a favorite?**  
A: Open any recipe and tap the star icon to add it to your favorites. Favorite recipes appear in a dedicated section for quick access.

**Q: Can I add photos to my recipes?**  
A: Photo support is planned for a future update. Currently, you can add detailed descriptions, ingredients, instructions, prep/cook times, and personal notes.

### Grocery Lists

**Q: Can I customize grocery categories?**  
A: The app uses predefined categories (Produce, Meat & Seafood, Dairy, Bakery, Pantry, Beverages, Frozen, Snacks, etc.) to keep shopping organized. You can sort and filter items within these categories.

**Q: How do I check off items while shopping?**  
A: Simply tap any item in your grocery list to mark it as purchased. Checked items move to the bottom of the list so you can focus on what you still need.

### Inventory Management

**Q: How does inventory tracking work?**  
A: Add items to your pantry, fridge, or freezer with quantities, purchase dates, and expiry dates. When you use ingredients in recipes, the app can automatically deduct them from inventory. The app will alert you when items are expiring soon.

**Q: Can I track prices for inventory items?**  
A: Yes! You can record purchase prices and track price history to help with budgeting and finding the best deals over time.

### Data & Syncing

**Q: Is my data backed up?**  
A: Yes! Your data syncs to iCloud automatically across all your devices. You can also export all data to a JSON file as an additional backup. Go to Settings > Export Data to create a backup file.

**Q: How do I restore my data on a new device?**  
A: Sign in with the same Apple ID, and your data will sync automatically via iCloud. If you have an exported JSON backup, you can import it via Settings > Import Data.

**Q: What if family sharing isn't syncing?**  
A: Ensure all family members are signed in to iCloud and have granted the app permission to use CloudKit. Check that you have a stable internet connection. If issues persist, try toggling Family Sharing off and on in Settings.
